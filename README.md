# Purpose

Given information about good* gauge-frequency string pairs,
this computes good string gauges for frequencies not in that data.

# The Python code is better.

It works with CSV data.

The Haskell code is more convenient for ad-hoc calculations,
but it doesn't handle tables.

# What is "middle C" in 41-edo

Since I'm interested in A-440,
C is defined in terms of that:
C = 440 * 2 ** (10/41)
